          Two of my greatest passions are climbing and skydiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been climbing literally since the cradle,from which I'm told I would escape any time my family turned their backs, and then crawl and scamper all over the place, usually in an attempt to get outside and look for puppies.

          Later, I learned to climb the furniture, then trees, the house, local buildings, and eventually, mountains.
        </p>
        Most of the climbing I've done has been free solo, meaning without ropes or partners, but I'm now learnng belay technique at my local climbing gym, with the aim of climbing the Shawangunks with a group in the spring.
      </p>
        <p>
        I first began skydiving as a lark while on holiday in Arizona about nine years ago and discovered the intensely beautiful experience that is being in the sky. From that momment, I knew skydiving would be an important part of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I returned to New York, I began training for a solo license at Skydive the Rance, a drop zone north of New York City. Since then, I have learned arial acrobatic movments and hope to do a group drop soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both climbing and skydiving are among the most intensely exhilarating experiences one can have in this life and I am grateful that I get to live in an age when humans can fly on the wind and climb to the highest of places.
