# Basic-Portfolio

To complete the assignment, I followed the example from the tutorial video.

As part of the "bonus" homework, I added hover effects to the menu links in the navbar and a rollover for the contact form submit button.

I greatly appreciate the assistance I recieved from Ron and Alan and Kemet, without which I would have floundered and turned in a mess.

Please note: the reason the files are located in a folder called "new-portfolio" instead of the mandated "basic-portfolio" is due to my having a problem with git that I am going to need assistance with understanding.

Thanks, dudes!
